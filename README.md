# Study-O_SourceCode
 The source code for Study-O, located at: https://aquaash.itch.io/study-o

 The game was made in the Unity Game Engine version 2022.3.11f1
 If you want to see the game in unity download the folder and tell unity to locate it as a project folder

 If you just want to review the code, the code is located in the folder Assets -> Scripts. Any file ending in .cs is something I wrote. There are subfolders for each different topic, please forgive my organizational skills though.
 The longest script is the Player.cs script, It is in Assets -> Scripts -> PlayerScripts.
